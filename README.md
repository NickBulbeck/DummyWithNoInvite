# DummyWithNoInvite
Testing how to interact with a repo you've not been formally invited to.

Interestingly, the new CodeOwners feature is enabled. Actually, this may or may not turn out to be interesting.
Adding another line to this README, and I expect to be able to commit locally but not to be able to push back into central repo.
